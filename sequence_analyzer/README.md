# Biological Sequence Analyzer

This is a tool for analyzing biological sequences such as DNA and RNA. Protein Sequence analysis functionality will be built in later.

## Features

- [x] DNA Sequence Analysis
- [x] RNA Sequence Analysis
- [ ] Protein Sequence Analysis
- Sequence analysis that can be performed:
  - [x] Sequence Length
  - [x] Sequence Transcription
  - [x] Sequence Translation
  - [x] Sequence GC content evaluation
  - [x] Sequence ORF detection and evaluation
  - [ ] Sequence Analysis
  - [ ] Sequence Comparison
  - [ ] Sequence Alignment

## Technologies

- The tool will be built using Python and will use the Biopython library for sequence analysis.
- The tool will be built using the FastAPI framework for the API and the Streamlit library for the web interface.
- The tool will be deployed using Docker.
